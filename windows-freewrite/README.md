## Why Freewrite?

Freewriting is a writing strategy developed in 1973 — it's where you write continuously for a set time without worrying about grammar, spelling, or anything like that. A pure stream of consciousness.

Some basic rules:
- No backspaces
- No fixing spelling
- Little 5–10s breaks are fine, but try to not stop typing
- No need to stay on the topic you started with — let your mind wander
- No judgment — trust your mind!
